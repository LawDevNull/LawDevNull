### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my personal repository on GitHub, where I store information about various personal projects because I'm better at Markdown than I am at web design 😄

GitHub provides some initial questions to fill out this ReadMe, so I'm using those until I come up with something more insightful to put here –
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: the 9th Annual [Bull City Foodraiser](https://github.com/LawDevNull/BullCityFoodraiser/), which will run from December 9-12, 2025. Let me know if you'd like to support!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: everything I can about all the GitHub services, because that's my day job :shipit: 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: anything fun or impactful that also meshes with my (predominantly law-related) skillsets ⚖️
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: [fundraising for the Bull City Foodraiser](https://github.com/LawDevNull/BullCityFoodraiser/blob/main/DONATE.md) 🥺🥺🥺
- 💬 Ask me about: any legal-related questions about GitHub Copilot (seriously, anything)
- 📫 How to reach me: use one of the social media apps linked in my profile. I check all of them pretty regularly.
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him / his
- ⚡ Fun fact: my GitHub handle came from the title of my law school blog, `law:/dev/null` -- I had a GitHub account before I started working here!
